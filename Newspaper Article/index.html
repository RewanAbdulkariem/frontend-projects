                “This is only the beginning,” said Dr. Lina Farouk, one of the lead engineers behind the project. “We believe VisionMind will be a game-changer not just in medicine, but in how people interact with technology across all sectors.” Governments and tech companies are already in talks to bring the system into broader use by next year.
